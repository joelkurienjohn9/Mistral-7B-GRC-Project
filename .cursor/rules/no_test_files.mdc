# Test File Rules

- **DO NOT** create, update, or modify test files unless the user explicitly requests it
- **DO NOT** proactively suggest writing tests or generating test cases
- Only work on test files when the user specifically asks with phrases like:
  - "write tests"
  - "create tests"
  - "add unit tests"
  - "generate test cases"
- User's explicit request overrides this rule
